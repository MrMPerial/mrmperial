### Hi there 👋
## I'm Christopher but most people call me Chris.

### NOTE: I am currently available for new opportunities. I'm looking for a great company that loves to innovate and build their team.

---

Self-Taught, I started some basic coding back in 2011 with WordPress and HTML. Since then, I have worked with some great companies both as an employee as well as a freelance developer.

I fell in love with JavaScript back in 2014 and have maintianed a pretty solid focus on that specifically for some time.

In 2015, I found [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) and that really changed my life, giving me a great advantage on learning more complex JS skills.

In 2016, I attended a new program offered by the [University of Arkansas Global Campus](https://training.uark.edu) - the _IT Readiness Program_. I took the Front End class as well as the Back End class building projects with **NodeJS**. Here I was able to build a music platform for singers to upload and share their own music along with the ability to share on social media.

One of my favorite projects has actually been one of the simplest to complete. It's a simple bash script that builds out a new templated NodeJS project ready to be worked on.
